# learning_qiskit

Introductory examples to understand concepts of quantum computing using the qiskit library.
This project is just for learning and teaching purposes and it is not intended as a complete guide to qiskit but rather as a tool to visualize and grasp some ideas about quantum algorithms and their applications.
